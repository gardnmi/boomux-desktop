# Boomux Desktop

A fast native tiling terminal workspace for [Boomux](https://github.com/gardnmi/boomux), built with GPUI and Ghostty's terminal core.

> [!WARNING]
> Boomux Desktop is experimental. It currently proves the terminal, graphics,
> input, and tiling architecture; it is not yet packaged as a stable desktop
> application.

The prototype uses [GPUI Community Edition](https://gpui-ce.github.io/) and `libghostty-vt`, pinned to released crate versions for reproducible builds. Boomux remains the shell backend: it owns the PTY lifecycle, persistence, reconstruction, and transport, while libghostty interprets those bytes and maintains the reflowing terminal grid rendered by GPUI.

The layout panes are managed inside one GPUI window, and every pane hosts an independent **real local Boomux shell**. Each pane renders its shell's terminal output in GPUI and sends keyboard input and terminal resize events back through Boomux's attachment protocol. This lets us test the product shape without embedding Wayland client buffers or running a terminal emulator process per tile.

An Omarchy Boomux-inspired sidebar presents the local workspace tree, shell status, and current/attention-bearing agents. When an agent settles from working to idle, its row remains marked **finished** until **Dismiss** is clicked; durable Boomux attention is acknowledged with the exact observation revision. Workspace rows expand and collapse. Clicking a shell or agent focuses its existing tile, or attaches its shell in a new tile when it is not already open. The overview refreshes from Boomux in the background without putting daemon requests on the GPUI render path. Nodes and web controls remain outside this proof of concept.

## Run it

```sh
cargo run
```

Building the vendored libghostty dependency requires Zig 0.15.2 on `PATH`. It is only needed at build time. If Zig is installed somewhere outside `PATH`, prepend that directory when invoking Cargo:

```sh
PATH=/path/to/zig-0.15.2:$PATH cargo run
```

The Boomux client dependency is pinned to the exact Boomux v1.9.5 release
revision for reproducible standalone builds. Boomux Desktop requires a Boomux
daemon at v1.9.3 or newer because that release added the primary-controller
backpressure required for reliable high-volume Kitty graphics; v1.9.5 is the
currently pinned and tested release. On startup the app selects the most
recently focused local Boomux Shell, falling back to the first available Shell,
then opens every Shell in its Workspace and focuses the selected one. A pending
Shell starts, an exited Shell restarts, and a running Shell is taken over from
its current terminal attachment. There is no intermediate shell picker.

For development and repeatable terminal integration tests, `BOOMUX_DESKTOP_SHELL_ID=<exact-local-shell-id>` overrides the initial shell selection.

`Ctrl + Enter` creates a new Shell and opens it in a new tile. With terminal focus, it uses the focused terminal's Boomux Workspace. With sidebar focus, it uses the selected Workspace or the parent Workspace of the selected Shell or Agent. New Shells use collision-safe random `adjective-noun` names. The sidebar's `+` button creates a randomly named Workspace with its first randomly named Shell and opens it immediately. In the default single-Workspace pane mode, clicking a Workspace or pressing `Enter` while its row is selected opens its non-minimized Shells and collapses every other Workspace in the sidebar. Shells minimized with `Ctrl + W` remain minimized when switching away and returning to a Workspace. In Mixed mode, clicking a Workspace collapses or expands it without collapsing the others. `Space` also collapses or expands the selected Workspace, and **Open workspace** remains available from its `⋮` menu. Clicking an individual minimized Shell opens only that Shell. `Ctrl + W` and the pane header's minimize button close the focused tile and detach from its Shell; the Shell and its process remain alive in Boomux and can be reopened from the sidebar. Plain left-drag on a pane heading moves or rearranges it without affecting terminal text selection. The pane heading also provides float/dock, maximize/restore, and close buttons. Maximize uses the same workspace-scoped fullscreen behavior as Layout mode's `F`; close permanently terminates and removes the Boomux Shell. Closing the app itself has the same detach-only behavior, preserving Boomux's normal persistence. Each Workspace row has a `⋮` menu for opening it, creating a Shell, renaming, or permanently removing the Workspace. Each Shell row has a `⋮` menu for renaming or permanently removing that Shell. Destructive operations require confirmation by default; **Confirm removals** in Settings can disable those prompts.

New Workspaces append to the bottom of the desktop's Workspace list. Drag a
Workspace row in either direction to reorder it; the dragged row follows the
pointer and neighboring rows slide into place using the selected motion speed.
You can also focus it in the sidebar and use `Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down`.

The application window title includes the Workspace owning the focused terminal
pane.

Kitty graphics are decoded by `libghostty-vt` and composited into each GPUI terminal canvas with placement cropping and z-ordering. This is sufficient for raw RGB/RGBA applications such as Terminal Doom. From a Boomux shell whose working directory contains `doom1.wad`, run:

```sh
/home/gardnmi/Projects/terminal-doom/zig-out/bin/terminal-doom
```

The prototype uses Ctrl on Linux so its input reaches the app while it is running under Hyprland; Super combinations are normally intercepted by the real compositor. GPUI's portable `secondary` modifier makes these Command shortcuts on macOS. `F1` opens the complete in-app shortcut reference:

| Shortcut | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `F1` | Open or close the keyboard-shortcut help menu |
| `F6` | Move keyboard focus between the sidebar and the active terminal |
| `F2` | Rename the selected sidebar Workspace/Shell, or the focused terminal's Shell |
| `Ctrl + Space` | Enter or leave Layout mode; press twice quickly to send Ctrl+Space to the terminal |
| `Ctrl + left drag` | Lift, move, and re-tile a tiled pane |
| `Ctrl + right drag` | Resize a tiled split or floating pane in both axes |
| Layout: `Arrow keys` or `H/J/K/L` | Focus a spatially adjacent pane |
| Layout: `Tab` or `Shift + Tab` | Cycle focus through panes forward or backward |
| Layout: `Shift + Arrow keys` or `Shift + H/J/K/L` | Slide-swap a tiled pane, or move a floating pane |
| Layout: `Alt + H/J/K/L` | Precisely resize the focused tiled or floating pane |
| Layout: `Alt + Arrow keys` | Resize the focused tiled or floating pane by a normal step |
| Layout: `Alt + Shift + H/J/K/L` | Resize the focused tiled or floating pane by a large step |
| Layout: `S/E/R` | Rotate, equalize, or swap the nearest split |
| Layout: `Alt + Shift + Arrow keys` | Align a floating pane to the corresponding canvas edge |
| Layout: `C` | Center a floating pane |
| Layout: `O/F/B` | Toggle floating, workspace maximize, or the sidebar drawer |
| Layout: `Page Up/Page Down` | Cycle backward or forward through Workspaces in sidebar order |
| Layout: `Escape` | Return to normal terminal input |
| `Ctrl + Enter` | Create a Boomux Shell in the selected or focused Workspace and open it in a new tile |
| `Ctrl + W` | Minimize and detach the focused pane, preserving its Boomux Shell and creating a top tab in Tabs layout |
| `Ctrl + Shift + W` | Permanently remove the selected or focused Boomux Shell |
| `Mouse wheel over terminal` | Scroll through retained terminal history |
| `Shift + Page Up/Page Down` | Scroll terminal history by one viewport, matching Ghostty on Linux |
| `Shift + Home/End` | Jump to the top or bottom of terminal history |
| `Left drag over terminal text` | Select visible terminal cells and publish the selection to the Linux primary clipboard |
| `Ctrl + Shift + C` | Copy the active terminal selection to the system clipboard |
| `Ctrl + Shift + V` | Paste the system clipboard into the focused terminal |
| `Super + C/V` on Omarchy | Universal copy/paste through Omarchy's terminal bindings |
| `Middle click` | Paste the Linux primary selection into the focused terminal |

Terminal keys use Ghostty's negotiated keyboard encoder. `Shift+Enter` uses the
portable Ctrl+J newline representation so it continues to insert a newline in
Codex even after attaching to an existing Shell whose earlier Kitty keyboard
negotiation is unavailable; plain `Enter` still submits. Other legacy keys
retain their conventional encodings.

While the sidebar has keyboard focus, `Up`/`Down` or `J`/`K` moves through
visible rows, `Left`/`Right` or `H`/`L` collapses and expands Workspaces,
`Enter` opens the selected Workspace or Shell, `Space` toggles a Workspace's
expanded state, `Ctrl+Enter` creates a Shell in that row's Workspace, `F2`
renames the selected Workspace or Shell, `Tab` moves between the Workspaces and
Agents sections, and `Escape` or `F6` returns to the terminal.

Focus follows the pointer as it moves over panes. Keyboard focus remains in the
sidebar when the pointer is stationary over a pane and returns to that pane only
after genuine pointer movement. Clicking still focuses a pane and begins any
requested drag operation.

The compact Boomux sidebar header keeps Workspace creation visible and places
Settings, Keyboard Shortcuts, and Hide Sidebar in its overflow menu. Settings
opens as a scrollable sidebar screen with consistent segmented and stepper
controls, and can disable removal confirmations. Layout mode's `B` command opens
the sidebar again after it has been closed.

On Omarchy, Boomux Desktop follows the active system theme automatically. It
loads the semantic palette and terminal ANSI colors from
`~/.local/state/omarchy/current/theme/colors.toml`, then watches Omarchy's
atomically replaced `current` theme directory for live changes. The sidebar,
settings, dialogs, pane chrome, focus treatment, terminal defaults, cursor, and
ANSI palette update without restarting or reconnecting panes. A missing or
invalid Omarchy theme uses Boomux Desktop's built-in palette, which also keeps
the application usable on non-Omarchy systems. Settings reports whether the
Omarchy provider or the fallback is active.

Settings default to **Workspace** pane scope: opening a Workspace replaces the
canvas with its remembered non-minimized Shells, while opening a Shell restores
only that Shell. **Mixed** scope preserves the free-form behavior where Shells
from different Workspaces can share the canvas. Settings can also hide pane
headings and switch the pane layout between **Tiled** (the default) and
**Tabs**. Tabs leaves every open terminal in the tiled and floating canvas.
When `Ctrl+W` minimizes a pane, its detached Boomux Shell appears in a strip
across the top; clicking that tab restores the Shell as a pane. Tabs keeps the
sidebar's Workspace list compact by hiding all nested Shell rows. The strip's
arrow controls reveal overflowed tabs, and each tab has a rename control. Tabs is
Workspace-only: selecting it changes pane
scope to **Workspace** and disables **Mixed** in Settings. Settings can also
switch pane edges between rounded, square, and
mixed. Mixed gives every pane a stable, randomly varied set of corner curves;
the same menu adjusts spacing between tiled panes, the strength of the focused
pane border and heading, and window-motion speed. Motion can be Instant, Fast,
or Smooth (the default) and applies to pane swaps, reflow, and tiled/floating
transitions. In Workspace scope it also slides the outgoing and incoming pane
sets in sidebar order when switching Workspaces. These options affect
presentation only and do not change Boomux resources.

Minimizing and restoring panes follows the selected motion speed. Fast and
Smooth animate the pane and surrounding layout; Instant applies the new layout
immediately.

Sidebar Shell indicators distinguish pane state from process state: `●` is the
focused pane, `◉` is another open pane, and `○` with `minimized` metadata means
the pane is closed while its durable Boomux Shell remains available.

Window spacing applies both between panes and around the workspace canvas; at
0px, panes meet each other and the canvas edges with no inset.

The **Keyboard shortcuts** overflow item opens the same help menu as `F1`. The menu lists shortcuts by section, prioritizes sidebar commands while the sidebar is active, supports the mouse wheel, Arrow keys, `J`/`K`, Page Up/Page Down, Home/End, and closes with `Escape` or `F1`. While it is open, its separate key context prevents pane commands from reaching the terminal or changing the layout behind the overlay.

Attached terminals show a scrollbar on their right edge. Its thumb is derived from libghostty's native `total`, `offset`, and `len` viewport state and can be dragged anywhere in retained history. The scrollbar fades in on hover, remains visible while dragged, fades out after exit, and keeps the normal arrow cursor.

When a Boomux terminal tile is focused, ordinary typing and common control and
navigation keys—including `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+Arrow`, and `Ctrl+H/J/K/L`—are sent
to the shell. `Ctrl+Space` enters an explicit Layout mode whose persistent
on-canvas indicator remains visible until `Escape` or `Ctrl+Space` exits it.

After a small movement threshold, a tiled pane is temporarily lifted into the floating layer and follows the pointer. Neighboring tiles ease into the freed space, and dropping over the left, right, top, or bottom side of another tile animates the pane back into the resulting tiled layout. A modified click without movement does not mutate geometry. Directional focus and swaps prioritize panes sharing the requested edge before falling back to diagonal candidates. Explicitly floating panes remain floating, rise above other floating panes when focused, and are clamped to the panel during keyboard movement and resizing; Layout mode's `O` command toggles that persistent mode with an eased grow-and-center transition.

Keyboard swaps use the same eased geometry transition, so both affected panes
slide between their previous and new tiled positions.

Workspace maximize temporarily expands the focused pane over the main terminal canvas while keeping the sidebar and its controls visible. Its tiled position or floating bounds remain unchanged and return with the reverse animation when Layout mode's `F` command is pressed again.

In Tabs layout, ordinary geometry and focus commands continue to operate on all
open tiled and floating panes. Tabs consume only the height needed for currently
minimized Shells and disappear when every tab has been restored.

## What this proves

- A binary split tree maps naturally to nested GPUI flex layouts.
- Focus can be calculated spatially instead of relying on DOM/render order.
- Tiled and floating layers can coexist in one GPUI scene.
- Hyprland-like operations can be expressed as ordinary GPUI actions.
- Multiple Boomux shells can be created, attached, reconstructed, rendered, typed into, resized, closed, detached, and reconnected without launching separate terminal windows.
- Kitty graphics capability negotiation, decoded RGB/RGBA images, placement clipping, and z-ordering can be bridged from a Boomux PTY through `libghostty-vt` into GPUI.

## What it does not prove yet

- Full Ghostty rendering parity. GPUI still performs its own cell and image drawing, so advanced cursor styles, PNG transmission, Unicode placeholders, animation, and some Kitty graphics edge cases remain incomplete.
- Mouse reporting for terminal applications, IME, selection spanning unloaded scrollback, hyperlinks, or ligatures.
- Hosting or compositing arbitrary Wayland clients.
- Compositor-grade animation physics and configurable animation curves
- Multiple workspaces and monitors
- Damage tracking, client lifecycle, or compositor security boundaries

The layout model is isolated in `src/layout.rs`; the Boomux lifecycle, attachment, and libghostty terminal adapter live in `src/terminal.rs`.

## Performance

Boomux Desktop is intended to stay responsive and memory-efficient as humans
and agents create more terminals than traditional single-user workflows. The
desktop client therefore treats bounded state, backpressure, render-path
isolation, and measured regressions as architectural requirements rather than
late optimization work.

Boomux owns server-side scale across Shells and attached clients. Boomux Desktop
owns the incremental cost of each visible terminal pane, decoded image, and
frame. See [docs/performance.md](docs/performance.md) for the measurement model
and [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the ownership boundary.
